# "CashCat" The Ransomware Simulator
A fun little ransomware simulator that will rename .TXT files to .LOCKY to simulate ransomware behavior for testing various monitoring tools.

THIS IS NOT A REAL RANSOMWARE! ALL IT DOES IS RENAME the extension of TXT FILES to .LOCKY 



Usage
1. Place CashCat.exe in a directory with some .txt files in the same directory.
2. Run Cashcast.exe.
3. All .TXT files located in the same directory as Cashcat.exe will be renamed to .Locky - a common ransomware extension
4. Enter the code 123456789 to rename all .LOCKY files to .TXT (this effectily UNLOCKS your files / resets your demo)
